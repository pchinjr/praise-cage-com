### Project Title: **"Holiday Hideaway: Stealthy Shopping Guide"**

### Description:
"Trapped in Paradise" is a comedy featuring Nicolas Cage as Bill Firpo, who, along with his brothers, gets stuck in a quirky small town during a heist gone wrong during the holiday season. The project, "Holiday Hideaway: Stealthy Shopping Guide," is inspired by the film's themes of misadventure and unexpected events, using the Page Visibility API to enhance the online holiday shopping experience with a twist.

This web application helps users find the best holiday deals stealthily. When the user needs to quickly hide their shopping from over-the-shoulder snoops (like family members you might be buying gifts for), the Page Visibility API is used to automatically pause any flashy animations or hide deal alerts when the user switches tabs or minimizes the browser window. This ensures that their holiday shopping remains a surprise.

### Project Title: **"Secrets Shared: Secure Messaging for VIPs"**

### Description:
"Guarding Tess" features Nicolas Cage as Doug Chesnic, a Secret Service agent assigned to protect a former First Lady, showcasing themes of protection and confidentiality. Leveraging these themes, "Secrets Shared: Secure Messaging for VIPs" is a web application that uses the Web Share API to allow users to share important information securely and discreetly. This app is especially useful for individuals who need to maintain a high level of privacy in their communications, much like the security details surrounding VIPs.

This application enhances user privacy by facilitating the secure sharing of messages and files directly through their device's native sharing capabilities, minimizing exposure to third-party services and maximizing operational security.

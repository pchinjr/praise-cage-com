### Project Title: **"Nightly Narratives: A Vampire's Stream"**

### Description:
"Vampire's Kiss," starring Nicolas Cage as Peter Loew, is a film about a man descending into madness, believing himself to be turning into a vampire. Drawing inspiration from this theme of transformation and illusion, "Nightly Narratives: A Vampire's Stream" is a web application that lets users create and share their own gothic-style narratives through live video streaming, enhanced with real-time video effects that give a supernatural appearance.

Leveraging the Media Capture and Streams API, this application allows users to capture video from their webcams, apply various filters (like grayscale, sepia, or even more eerie effects), and stream this content live to a dedicated channel where others can watch and interact. This project creates a platform for storytelling and role-playing, inviting users to immerse themselves in a vampiric persona akin to Peter Loew's.
